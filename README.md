# Badger File Reader

Hi all! This is mostly an experimental, badger-themed personal project.

Currently, this repo implements the [[MS-OVBA]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-ovba/575462ba-bf67-4190-9fac-c275523c75fc) with minimal dependencies and comes with a very stripped down CLI wrapper.


Again, this is experimental. If you're looking for a working version of this implementation, I would recommend the Rust [ovba](https://github.com/tim-weis/ovba) crate.

## Todo's
**********
1. Compression algorithm's and write in [MS-OVBA]
2. Look into implementing [MS-OFORMS]
3. Build out CLI and clean up output
